So, we have this operation defined as a⊗b = a²/b. And we need to compute [(1⊗2)⊗3] - [1⊗(2⊗3)]. Then choose the correct answer from the options given. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to remember that the operation ⊗ is not associative, right? Because the problem is asking for the difference between two different groupings: (1⊗2)⊗3 and 1⊗(2⊗3). So, the order in which we perform the operations matters here. That's probably why there's a subtraction between them.\\n\\nLet me start by computing each part separately. Let's tackle the first part: (1⊗2)⊗3.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost operation, which is 1⊗2. According to the definition, a⊗b = a²/b. So here, a is 1 and b is 2. Plugging those in: 1² / 2 = 1/2. So, 1⊗2 equals 1/2.\\n\\nNow, we take that result and perform the next operation with 3. So, (1⊗2)⊗3 becomes (1/2)⊗3. Again, using the same definition: a is now 1/2 and b is 3. So, ( (1/2)² ) / 3 = (1/4) / 3 = 1/12. So, (1⊗2)⊗3 equals 1/12.\\n\\nAlright, that's the first part. Now let's compute the second part: 1⊗(2⊗3). Again, starting with the innermost operation, which is 2⊗3. Applying the definition: a is 2 and b is 3. So, 2² / 3 = 4/3. Therefore, 2⊗3 equals 4/3.\\n\\nNow, we need to compute 1⊗(4/3). Here, a is 1 and b is 4/3. Using the operation definition: 1² / (4/3) = 1 / (4/3) = 3/4. So, 1⊗(2⊗3) equals 3/4.\\n\\nNow, the problem asks for the difference between the two results: [(1⊗2)⊗3] - [1⊗(2⊗3)] = (1/12) - (3/4). To subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 12 and 4, so 12 is the common denominator.\\n\\nConverting 3/4 to twelfths: 3/4 = 9/12. So, 1/12 - 9/12 = (1 - 9)/12 = -8/12. Simplifying that fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: -8/12 = -2/3.\\n\\nHmm, looking at the answer choices, option A is -2/3. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\\n\\nFirst, checking (1⊗2): 1² / 2 = 1/2. Correct. Then, (1/2)⊗3: (1/2)² / 3 = (1/4)/3 = 1/12. That seems right.\\n\\nNow, for 2⊗3: 2² / 3 = 4/3. Correct. Then, 1⊗(4/3): 1² / (4/3) = 1 / (4/3) = 3/4. Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nSubtracting 3/4 from 1/12: 1/12 - 3/4. Convert 3/4 to 9/12, so 1/12 - 9/12 = -8/12 = -2/3. Yes, that all checks out. So the answer should be -2/3, which is option A.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. The operation is defined for all nonzero numbers, so we don't have any issues with division by zero here. 2⊗3 is 4/3, which is fine, and then 1⊗(4/3) is 3/4. Correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach the problem? Let me try expanding both expressions using variables to see if there's a pattern.\\n\\nLet’s denote the first expression: (a⊗b)⊗c. Using the definition:\\n\\nFirst, compute a⊗b = a²/b.\\n\\nThen, take that result and ⊗ with c: (a²/b)⊗c = ( (a²/b)² ) / c = a⁴ / (b² c).\\n\\nNow, the second expression: a⊗(b⊗c). First compute b⊗c = b²/c.\\n\\nThen, a⊗(b²/c) = a² / (b²/c) = a² * (c / b²) = (a² c) / b².\\n\\nTherefore, the difference between the two expressions is:\\n\\n(a⁴ / (b² c)) - (a² c / b²) = (a⁴ - a² c²) / (b² c) = a² (a² - c²) / (b² c).\\n\\nHmm, factoring that, it's a² (a - c)(a + c) / (b² c).\\n\\nBut in our specific problem, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3. Plugging those values in:\\n\\n1² (1 - 3)(1 + 3) / (2² * 3) = 1 * (-2)(4) / (4 * 3) = (-8) / 12 = -2/3. Same result. So that confirms the answer is indeed -2/3.\\n\\nTherefore, I think my initial calculation was correct, and the answer is option A.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{A}\\n\\n<|end_of_thought|>\\n\\n<|begin_of_solution|>\\n\\nTo determine the value of \\\\([(1 \\\\otimes 2) \\\\otimes 3] - [1 \\\\otimes (2 \\\\otimes 3)]\\\\) where the operation \\\\(\\\\otimes\\\\) is defined by \\\\(a \\\\otimes b = \\\\frac{a^2}{b}\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\nFirst, compute \\\\(1 \\\\otimes 2\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n1 \\\\otimes 2 = \\\\frac{1^2}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\n\\\\]\\nNext, use this result to compute \\\\((1 \\\\otimes 2) \\\\otimes 3\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right) \\\\otimes 3 = \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^2}{3} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{4}}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{12}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNow, compute \\\\(2 \\\\otimes 3\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n2 \\\\otimes 3 = \\\\frac{2^2}{3} = \\\\frac{4}{3}\\n\\\\]\\nThen, use this result to compute \\\\(1 \\\\otimes (2 \\\\otimes 3)\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n1 \\\\otimes \\\\left(\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1^2}{\\\\frac{4}{3}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{4}{3}} = \\\\frac{3}{4}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFinally, find the difference between the two results:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{1}{12} - \\\\frac{3}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{12} - \\\\frac{9}{12} = \\\\frac{1 - 9}{12} = \\\\frac{-8}{12} = -\\\\frac{2}{3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the answer is \\\\(\\\\boxed{A}\\\\).\\n\\n<|end_of_solution|>\"}]}\n",
